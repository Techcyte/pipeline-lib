# Contribution Guidelines

We welcome:

- Bug reports
- Pull requests for bug fixes
- Documentation improvements
- Well aligned feature additions*

*Feature additions will be considered, but will be reviewed with some scrutiny, and will be rejected if not in line with the project goals outlined in the first section of the README. 

## Contributing to the codebase

### Coding

Contributing code is done through standard github methods:

1. Fork this repo
2. Commit your code
3. Submit a pull request. It will be reviewed by maintainers and they'll give feedback or make requests as applicable

### Considerations
- Make sure existing tests pass with `pytest test`
- Make sure your new code is properly tested (not needed for documentation changes)
- For feature additions, make sure the feature is documented appropriately in the README.md
